	abstract = {Due to its reported high sampling frequency and precision, the Tobii Pro Spectrum is of potential interest to researchers who want to study small eye movements during fixation. We test how suitable the Tobii Pro Spectrum is for research on microsaccades by computing data-quality measures and common properties of microsaccades and comparing these to the currently most used system in this field: the EyeLink 1000 Plus. Results show that the EyeLink data provide higher RMS precision and microsaccade rates compared with data acquired with the Tobii Pro Spectrum. However, both systems provide microsaccades with similar directions and shapes, as well as rates consistent with previous literature. Data acquired at 1200 Hz with the Tobii Pro Spectrum provide results that are more similar to the EyeLink, compared to data acquired at 600 Hz. We conclude that the Tobii Pro Spectrum is a useful tool for researchers investigating microsaccades.},

	abstract = {People can learn and use both static and dynamic (cross-trial) regularities in the positioning of target items during parallel, ‘pop-out’ visual search. Static target-location learning also works in serial search, however, acquiring dynamic regularities is hindered by the demands of item-by-item scanning. Also, questions have been raised regarding whether explicit awareness is necessary for using dynamic regularities to optimize performance. The present study re-examined if dynamic regularities can be learned in serial search when regular shifts of the target location occur frequently, and if such learning correlates with awareness of the dynamic rule. We adopted the same regularity used by Yu et al. (2023) to demonstrate dynamic learning in parallel search: a cross-trial shift of the target location in a (counter-)clockwise direction within a circular array in 80 \% of the trials, compared to irregular shifts in the opposite direction (10 \%) or some other random direction (10 \%). The results showed that about 70 \% of participants learned the dynamic regularity, with performance gains correlating with awareness: the more accurately they estimated the likelihood of the target shifting in the frequent direction, the greater their gains. Importantly, part of the gains accrued already early during the search: a large proportion of the very first and short-latency eye movements were directed to the predicted location, regardless of the target appeared there. We discuss whether this rule-driven behavior is causally mediated by conscious control.},

	abstract = {One of the main characteristics of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are problems with social interaction and communication. Here, we explored ASD-related alterations in ‘reading’ body language of other humans. Accuracy and reaction times were assessed from two observational tasks involving the recognition of ‘biological motion’ and ‘emotions’ from point-light displays (PLDs). Eye movements were recorded during the completion of the tests. Results indicated that typically developed-participants were more accurate than ASD-subjects in recognizing biological motion or emotions from PLDs. No accuracy differences were revealed on two control-tasks (involving the indication of color-changes in the moving point-lights). Group differences in reaction times existed on all tasks, but effect sizes were higher for the biological and emotion recognition tasks. Biological motion recognition abilities were related to a person’s ability to recognize emotions from PLDs. However, ASD-related atypicalities in emotion recognition could not entirely be attributed to more basic deficits in biological motion recognition, suggesting an additional ASD-specific deficit in recognizing the emotional dimension of the point light displays. Eye movements were assessed during the completion of tasks and results indicated that ASD-participants generally produced more saccades and shorter fixation-durations compared to the control-group. However, especially for emotion recognition, these altered eye movements were associated with reductions in task-performance.},
