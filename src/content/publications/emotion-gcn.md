abstract: "We present a novel approach to emotion recognition from body motion data using graph convolutional networks. Our method captures the spatial relationships between body joints and temporal dynamics of movement to classify emotional states with high accuracy."

Body motion carries rich information about human emotional states. In this work, we propose a graph convolutional network architecture specifically designed for emotion recognition from skeleton data. Our approach models the human body as a graph where joints are nodes and bones are edges, allowing the network to learn spatial patterns of emotional expression.
